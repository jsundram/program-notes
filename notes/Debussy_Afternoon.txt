Prelude to <i>L&#146; apres midi d&#146;un faune</i> (The Afternoon of a Faun) (1894) 
Claude Debussy (August 22, 1862&#150;March 25, 1918) 
 
Camille Saint-Saens said &#147;[The Afternoon of a Faun] has a pretty sound, but there is not the least truly musical idea in it; it is no more a piece of music than the palette on which a painter has been working is a picture.&#148;
Debussy&#146;s original ambition was to be a sailor. To modern audiences, it is nearly inconceivable to imagine the father of impressionism in music as a sailor, but as late as 1889, Debussy answered a questionnaire asking what career he would have pursued, if not that of a musician&#151;&#147;a sailor.&#148; 

In 1872, he entered the Paris conservatoire as a student of Marmontel. After only a year, his teacher reported that Debussy had &#147;a true artistic temperament; much can be expected of him.&#148; By July of 1875, his piano skills were such that he was reported to be &#147;a twelve year old prodigy who promises to be a virtuoso of the first order.&#148;
 
It soon became apparent that Debussy was not to be a performer. In the words of his teacher: &#147;He doesn&#146;t care much for the piano, but he does love music.&#148; It was in his theory classes with Albert Lavignac (1873-76) that he really caught fire. Although he frequently questioned and argued with his professors, his ability was clear. In 1876, he completed his earliest mature composition, <i>Nuit d&#146; toiles.</i>
 
In 1880, Tchaikovsky&#146;s fourth symphony was premiered in Paris. As Tchaikovsky was in Paris seven times between 1883 and 1892, it is hard to explain why the two great composers never met. Yet <i>Afternoon</i> clearly shows Tchaikovsky&#146;s influence. The horn writing in the central part of <i>Afternoon</i> is reminiscent of the love scenes of Tchaikovsky&#146;s <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>.
 
<i>Afternoon</i> was one of the early masterpieces that established Debussy as major composer. In 1892, he began work on a composition inspired by <i>L’Après-midi d&#146;un faune</i> (&#147;The Afternoon of a Faun&#148;), a pastoral poem published in 1876 by the symbolist writer Stephane Mallarme. Before finding its final form, <i>Afternoon</i> underwent dramatic changes. From its original conception as incidental music to accompany a reading, by mid-1894 it was ready to be performed as<i> Prelude, Interludes and Final Paraphrase for &#147;The Afternoon of a Faun&#148;</i>, but Debussy withdrew the score for revision. By December, <i>The Afternoon of a Faun</i> as it is known today was given its debut in Paris.
 
In <i>Afternoon</i>, Debussy sought to record fleeting impressions, as in poetry. He decided to &#147;sacrifice dramatic action to an expression of the long exploration of inner feelings.&#148; Prokofiev responded to this, saying in 1913 that Debussy&#146;s music was &#147;not sufficiently meaty.&#148; The rhapsodic character of the piece is established from the beginning, with the flute entrance. The now-famous ballet that popularized <i>Afternoon</i>, choreographed by the Russian <I>danseur</I> Ninjinsky, was first performed in Paris 1912, with Ninjinsky as the Faun. 
 
On his copy of the published music, Mallarmé wrote: &#147;When the flute music is well played, you hear all the light that Debussy’s first breath blows through the forest!&#148;
