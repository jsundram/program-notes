# Overture to *La Cenerentola* (1817)
by Gioachino Rossini (February 29, 1792&ndash;November 13, 1868)

Known for the breakneck speed at which he wrote operas, Rossini purportedly finished composing an aria in the time it took him to cook a pot of noodles. His operatic overtures were frequently reused and hastily composed. His most famous opera, *Il Barbiere di Siviglia*, was written in 13 days, and, as was usual for Rossini, the well-known overture was actually taken from another of his operas.  Although his theatrical career began at age 18, by the time Rossini was 37, he had written 37 operas. *La Cenerentola*, written at age 25 (a fairly early work for Rossini) was premiered on January 25, 1817 in Rome's Teatro Valle.

Like other of Rossini's overtures, the overture to *Cenerentola* was taken from an earlier opera, *La Gazzeta* (1816). However, the spirit of the overture seems appropriate to *Cenerentola*. The librettist took a few liberties with the Cinderella story most of us know it. There are no magical aspects to it. Instead of a fairy godmother, there is Alidoro, a kindly philosopher. Instead of glass slippers, there is a bracelet that is placed on Cinderella's wrist by the prince. The opera itself, however, is pure magic.
