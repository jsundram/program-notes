A year before his death in 1948, Richard Strauss composed the magnificent *Four Last Songs*, expressing a calm acceptance of the inevitability of his own death.  The songs meditate on life, death, and the transition into "the magic circle of the night." In 1946, Strauss discovered *Im Abendrot*, a poem by the great lyric poet Joseph Eichendorff (1788-1857). The poem seems to have inspired Strauss to compose a work that would prepare him for death. The gift of Herman Hesse's (1877-1962) poetry from an admirer inspired Strauss to add four more songs to *Im Abendrot*, forming a group of songs inhabiting the same musical atmosphere. Ultimately, Strauss completed only three of these. He did not live to hear the work performed.

The *Four Last Songs* were written within five months. Because Strauss didn't specify a performance order, the songs&mdash;although composed in the order *Im Abendrot* ("Evening's Glow"), *Fr&uuml;hling* ("Spring"), *September*, then *Beim Schlafengehen*("Going to Sleep")&mdash;were ordered differently at their premiere, and differently still in publication. In the premiere, given by Kirsten Flagstad, Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler, and the Philharmonia Orchestra on May 22, 1950, the songs were performed in the reverse order of composition, ending with *Im Abendrot*. Strauss's friend Dr. Ernst Roth published the songs in their current order, so that the songs progress from Spring to September. 

The tradition of the *lied*, a poem set to music and sung, began with Schubert and was continued by Schumann. In the compositions of Strauss, Mahler and Wolf, the *lied*, originally for voice and piano, was gradually expanded to include the possibility of orchestral accompaniment.  Strauss wrote *lieder* for his wife Pauline, a noted soprano, and often accompanied her on the piano. It is likely that he had her voice in his head when he composed the *Four Last Songs* for soprano and orchestra. Although not the first to write *lieder* for voice and orchestra, Strauss' work creates a unique sense of intimacy through its evocative orchestration.  The use of orchestra, rather than piano, is indicative of both Strauss' orchestral skill (his treatise on orchestration is a definitive work), and his conception of these works as chamber music on a symphonic scale. In *Beim Schlafengehen*, an extended violin solo is sweetly evocative of "the unguarded spirit [wanting] to float on free wings."

In *Im Abendrot*, at the line "can this then be death," Strauss quotes the Transfiguration motif from one of the tone poems that made him famous, *Tod und Verkl&auml;rung* ("Death and Transfiguration"). Wrote Strauss in 1894 letter about *Tod und Verkl&auml;rung*: "The hour of death approaches, the soul leaves the body in order to find gloriously achieved in everlasting space those things which could not be fulfilled here below." On his deathbed, Strauss revealed: "Dying is just as I composed it in *Tod und Verkl&auml;rung*."
  
  
**Fr&uuml;hling** (Hesse)  
In twilit caverns
  
I dreamed long  
of your trees and blue skies,  
your fragrance and birdsong.  
  
Now you lie revealed  
in glistening splendour,  
bathed in light  
like a miracle before me.  
  
You know me once more;  
you beckon me tenderly  
My whole body trembles  
at your divine presence.  
  
  
**Beim Schlafengehen** (Hesse)  
Now that I feel the tiredness of  
the day,  
my deep longing shall  
welcome the starlit night  
as a weary child does.  
  
Hands, cease your toiling,  
head, forget about thinking,  
for all my senses now  
are longing to sink themselves in  
slumber.  
  
And the unguarded spirit  
wants to float on free wings, so that  
in the magic circle of the night  
it may live deeply and a thousandfold.  
  
  
**September** (Hesse)  
The garden is in mourning.  
Cool falls the rain upon the  
flowers.  
Summer shudders, quietly  
 to its end.  
  
Leaf after golden leaf drops  
down from the high acacia tree.  
Summer smiles, surprised and weary  
upon the dying dream of this garden.  
  
Yet still it lingers by the roses,  
longing for rest.  
Then slowly closes its great  
weary eyes.  
  
  
**Im Abendrot** (Eichendorff)  
Through trouble and joy we have  
walked hand in hand;  
we can rest from our wanderings  
now, above the peaceful country-side.  
  
The valleys fall away around us,  
the sky is already darkening,  
Only a pair of larks still rise  
dreamily into the scented air.  
  
Come here, and let them fly  
For soon it will be time to sleep  
and we must not lose our way  
in this solitude.  
  
O broad, contented peace!  
So deep in the sunset glow,  
How exhausted we are with our  
wanderings &mdash;  
can this then be death?
