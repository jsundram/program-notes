## README

This is a collection of program notes that I wrote while I was a student at the University of Rochester, playing in the [Symphony Orchestra](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/mur/ensembles/symphonyorchestra/index.html) and the [Chamber Orchestra](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/mur/ensembles/chamberorchestra/index.html) under the direction of [Professor David Harman](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/mur/people/harman_david/index.html). A few of the notes in this repository were written for friend's recitals. I had been hosting them jankily on a web since 2002 or so, and decided it was finally time to host them in a reasonably modern way that would allow some edits, corrections, links, etc, and GitHub Pages seemed like a reasonable choice. 

I've gotten periodic reachouts asking for permission to use these in concert programs. I'm happy to see them used that way; I'd ask that if possible, you mail me a copy of the printed program. It's fun to see this work show up in various places across the world.
